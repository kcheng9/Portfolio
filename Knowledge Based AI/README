Knowledge Based AI projects all deal with taking a multiple-choice test.
These tests are image based. The goal is to choose the next image in a sequence.
Problems are formatted in 2x1, 2x2, or 3x3 problems.
2x1 problems appear as Image A : Image B  Image C : ? where the AI must choose ?.
2x2 problems appear as a 2x2 grid where Image A and Image B are in the top row, and Image C and ? are in the bottom row.
3x3 problems appear as a 3x3 grid expanded from the 2x2 grid where the AI chooses the bottom right corner image.

Each project evolves on the last. Project 2 uses text-translations of the images.
Project 4 uses the images themselves.

For each project, navigate to the src folder.

Run Project#.java to run the project.
Agent.java contains the AI Logic.
See Results.txt in the Project# folder to view printed results of the test.
See Project#Report.pdf to view thought process and results discussion.
